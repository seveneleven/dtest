= dtest

dtest automatically generates Delphi (DUnit) testsuites based on +.testsuite+ 
configurations.

For example, running 
 dtest make MyTests 
given a +MyTests.testsuite+ with content like this:
 TTestClass1:TestClass1.pas
 TTestClass2:TestClass2.pas 
will make a +MyTestsTestSuite.pas+ including the dependent Delphi units and 
generated code to register the test classes. Optionally, a +.dpr+ will be created.
